# DeltaSysAd
My Delta SysAd Induction Repo

## **CURRENT PROGRESS**
- Got to know the basic commands (Linux usage and management commands, YAML parsing using go-yq, bash scripting (and why working with fish would be tedious, as the syntax is different)
- Tried using the commands to get a feel of how to put them to work together

## **NOTE TO THE SENIORS**

- Yeah it is going to take quite a while for me to get done with the tasks, as I feel that gaining a good amount of experience from examples before hand helps to better learn the topics before the application of them in the tasks, so please do consider an extension of deadlines. Off to learning now ðŸ™‚
